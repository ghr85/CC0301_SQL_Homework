### Homework - Marvel cinema


Given a dataset you have been tasked with writing the CRUD
actions which will manipulate the table as per the [homework.md](homework.md).

* SQL is well known but don't get arrogant take it slow and deliberately

* Use OR logic to deal with multiple entries at once

* Remember commas and semi-colon placing is important - save yourself frustration and take it slow!

* Pay attention to the primary key, this will come in handy later when building, reading full RDBMS
